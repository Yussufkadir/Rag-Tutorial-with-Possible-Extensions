It is a rag tutorial from Daniel Bourke. Here is what I learned and possible extensions to the project.

What I have learned. 
- How to download and format a data that is going to be used in RAG without the help of Langchain.
- How to create word Embeddings.
- How to chunk stuff for Rag to understand.
- What is context window.
- Tokens and tokenization in more detail.
- How to download a LLM and use it.
- How to calculate if LLM fits to my own Hardware.
- Importance of prompting and that every LLM requiring its own input formatting

What I want to add in order to make it more personalized
- Adding mechanism to extract info from the images as well.
- Adding a webpage layout to make it more interactive (streamlit).
